                <li>The letters seen in the movie, including the contract, were all physically written by Lana Condor. During a lunch break Lana had to write several copies as her character Lara Jean rips them.</li>
                <li>
                    Noah Centineo improvised the spin scene in the cafeteria, where Peter enters with his hand in Lara Jean's back pocket (suggested by Lara Jean in the movie, and Peter himself in the book).</li>
                <li>
                    The wallpaper on Lara Jean's phone showing her and Peter asleep was actually the actors relaxing together off-set. A crew member snapped the picture of them and used it in the film.</li>
                <li>
                    Jenny Han, the author of the novel of the film, made a cameo appearance as a chaperone in the scene where Lara Jean and Lucas dance together.
