                <li>The real Perron family visited the set of the film.</li>
                <li>
                    The film broke box office records after bringing in a total of $41 million during its opening weekend. It stands as the third highest-grossing opening weekend for an R-rated horror film behind Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) and Hannibal (2001). The Conjuring made a total of $137 million at the domestic box office.

                <li>
                    When the movie was shown in the Philippines, some cinemas had to hire Catholic priests to bless the viewers before showing it. This was due to some viewers having reported a "Negative Presence" after watching the film. The priests also provided spiritual and psychological help to the viewers.

                    The state of Rhode Island does not require home sellers to disclose documented histories of a location's criminal activity (let alone alleged paranormal and supernatural hauntings) to potential buyers. This is why the Perrons were unaware of all previous events.
