            <p class="para">Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) is an experienced 911 operator but when she makes an error in judgment and a call ends
            badly, Jordan is rattled and unsure if she can continue, but then teenager Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is abducted
            and calls 911. Jordan is the one called upon to use all of her experience, insights and quick thinking to try to help
            Casey escape and also to make sure the man is brought to justice.</p>

                <li>In the opening scene, one of the callers into the 911 centre states "I think I'm having an overdose and so is my wife" - the line made famous by Edward Sanchez, a policeman who confiscated marijuana from a suspect and then made brownies with it. He called 911 when he thought he had taken too much.</li>
                <li>
                    Halle Berry visited a call center and hung out with 911 operators in preparation for her role. She found their job to be emotionally very stressful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Screenwriter Richard D'Ovidio got the idea for the film when his wife saw an interview with a 911 operator on TV.
                    Researching the subject, he visited the Los Angeles Metropolitan Communications Dispatch Center and was surprised to find that it had its own back-up generators, bulletproof windows and a moat.
