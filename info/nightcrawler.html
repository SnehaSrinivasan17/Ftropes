                <li>The coyote theme became so strong that it was considered as an alternate title.</li>
                <li>
                    Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed rode along with actual "nightcrawlers" in Los Angeles to prepare for their roles.</li>
                <li>
                    Dan Gilroy considered a backstory that would help explain how Lou Bloom became the amoral and damaged "survivor" he was in the film. However, he ultimately cut the entire idea from his script because he didn't want to either spend a lot of time on Lou's origin or make him very sympathetic. </li>
                <li>
                    During the scene where Jake Gyllenhaal screams at himself in the mirror, Gyllenhaal got so into this improvised scene that the mirror broke, cutting his hand. He was driven to the hospital by the director after a nineteen-hour day of working and got forty-six stitches in a four-hour long operation, returning to the set six hours after being discharged. This is the reason why Gyllenhaal had his hand behind his back in the scene where he tells the scrapyard owner his motto.
