                <li>It was originally Terry Crews who started saying "NINE NINE!" on set to help motivate other cast members. The writers liked this very much so they decided to add it into the series</li>
                <li>
                    Andy Samberg (Peralta) and Chelsea Peretti (Linetti) went to the same elementary school, just as their characters had in the series. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Despite multiple jokes being made about Amy being a bad dancer, Melissa Fumero has been a professionally trained dancer since childhood
                </li>
                <li>
                    After shooting each scene a few times verbatim, the actors then shoot a few more when they improvise to make the scene funnier if possible. This method is also used on Parks and Recreation (2009), co-created by this show's co-creator Michael Schur.
